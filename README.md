Wordle user stories:
- As a player, I want to start a new game of Wordle where I am presented with a random 5 letter hidden word that I have to guess for fun.
- The hidden word should change every day to a new random 5 letter word. Therefore, the user should only be able to play once per day.
- As a player, I want to receive feedback on my guesses to help me make further attempts. Correctly guessed letters should be highlighted yellow upon submission and correctly guessed letters in the correct position should be highlighted green.
- As a player, I want to see letters I have already guessed that are not present in the hidden word to help me keep track of what I have guessed.
- As a player, I want to have a maximum of 6 guesses to guess the hidden word to keep the game challenging and engaging.
- As a player, I want to be told when I have correctly guessed the hidden word.
- As a player, after 6 attempts I want to be told the hidden word after being unable to solve it so I can learn from the solution and improve.
- As a busy player, if I leave the application halfway through the game I want to be able to return to where I left off when revisiting later in the day. This would also stop cheating via resetting guess count.
- As a player, I want to be able to make an account so I can track my game statistics, such as the number of games won, lost, and the average number of attempts per game.
- As a player, I want the game to be accessible on various platforms, such as desktop, mobile, or web, to play at my convenience.
- As an impaired user, I want the game to have accessibility options such as a dark mode or high contrast colour setting.
